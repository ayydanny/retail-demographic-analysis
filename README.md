# Background and Overview
The retail sales dataset simulates a dynamic retail environment in 2023, including customer demographics and sales, to evaluate how customer age and gender influence purchasing behavior. This project aims to explore patterns and gain a better understanding of how age and gender categories may affect purchasing behavior and revenue. Gathering this information will provide better business insights into which product categories are successful or less successful among certain age and gender groups, and whether an algorithm can be used to promote advertising for certain product categories to specific groups.
